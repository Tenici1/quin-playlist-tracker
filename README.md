## Tracking Twitch.tv/Quin69's Chat-Requested Songs

This project tracks songs requested in Twitch.tv/Quin69's chat! It builds a playlist of viewer-requested songs using Sheepfarmer's chat logs.

**How It Works:**

We use Sheepfarmer's chat logs to record song requests, keeping the playlist up-to-date. Note that the accuracy depends on whether Quin69 uses the chat's playlist.

**Keeping It Accurate:**

If you spot a wrong song, it could be because:

- Quin69 isn't using the chat's playlist at that moment.
- The queue is out of date. To fix this, type `!song` in Quin69's chat to update the current song.
